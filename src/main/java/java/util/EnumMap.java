/**
 * A specialized {@link Map} implementation for use with enum type keys.  All
 * of the keys in an enum map must come from a single enum type that is
 * specified, explicitly or implicitly, when the map is created.  Enum maps
 * are represented internally as arrays.  This representation is extremely
 * compact and efficient.
 *
 * <p>Enum maps are maintained in the <i>natural order</i> of their keys
 * (the order in which the enum constants are declared).  This is reflected
 * in the iterators returned by the collections views ({@link #keySet()},
 * {@link #entrySet()}, and {@link #values()}).
 *
 * <p>Iterators returned by the collection views are <i>weakly consistent</i>:
 * they will never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException} and they may
 * or may not show the effects of any modifications to the map that occur while
 * the iteration is in progress.
 *
 * <p>Null keys are not permitted.  Attempts to insert a null key will
 * throw {@link NullPointerException}.  Attempts to test for the
 * presence of a null key or to remove one will, however, function properly.
 * Null values are permitted.

 * <P>Like most collection implementations <tt>EnumMap</tt> is not
 * synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum map concurrently, and at
 * least one of the threads modifies the map, it should be synchronized
 * externally.  This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some
 * object that naturally encapsulates the enum map.  If no such object exists,
 * the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Map&lt;EnumKey, V&gt; m
 *         = Collections.synchronizedMap(new EnumMap&lt;EnumKey, V&gt;(...));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: All basic operations execute in constant time.
 * They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be faster than their
 * {@link HashMap} counterparts.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
